MERN Stack is a website development from Front-End to Back-End using one programming language, namely Javascript. MERN stands for several powerful development technologies: M for MongoDB (Database); E for Express (Framework); R for ReactJS (FE); and N for NextJS (FE) and NodeJS (core BE).

In fact, Javascript has been known to be very popular and flexible because it can be used in conjunction with other programming languages.

In the programming world, Javascript has provided a lot of value over the past 25 years, and understanding Javascript through this class can be a valuable investment in your long-term career as a Developer.

In this class, we will create a complex project in the form of a website top up game “STORE GG”. The material starts from the FE side, including changing the HTML design template that we have sliced ​​into NextJS. To easily manage large-scale data, library components will be organized according to Atomic Design principles. On the BE side, the main NodeJS framework is used for routing, middleware, database integration to testing. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) will also be used to manage database content as needed. Then API integration is implemented on both sides to allow data access on the same server. Once completed, the project is saved on GitHub and uploaded to the real-time platform for easy data updates at a later date.
