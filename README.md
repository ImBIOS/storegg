# Game Voucher Top Up Website

English | [Bahasa Indonesia](./README.id.md)

MERN Stack is a website development from Front-End to Back-End using one programming language, namely Javascript. MERN stands for several powerful development technologies: M for MongoDB (Database); E for Express (Framework); R for ReactJS (FE); and N for NextJS (FE) and NodeJS (core BE).

In fact, Javascript has been known to be very popular and flexible because it can be used in conjunction with other programming languages. Able to work on both the FE and BE sides at the same time, Javascript can create an attractive website appearance and manage data logic well. In the programming world, Javascript has provided a lot of value over the past 25 years, and understanding Javascript through this class can be a valuable investment in your long-term career as a Developer.

In this class, we will create a complex project in the form of a website top up game “STORE GG”. The material starts from the FE side, including changing the HTML design template that we have sliced ​​into NextJS. To easily manage large-scale data, library components will be organized according to Atomic Design principles. On the BE side, the main NodeJS framework is used for routing, middleware, database integration to testing. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) will also be used to manage database content as needed. Then API integration is implemented on both sides to allow data access on the same server. Once completed, the project is saved on GitHub and uploaded to the real-time platform for easy data updates at a later date.

This class is suitable for those of you who want to explore website development with Javascript. By knowing the whole process properly and correctly, we can improve our skills as developers and of course the applications produced in the future will be of higher quality. To make learning easier, please understand the fundamentals of Javascript, React, and Databases first. And please also ask our expert Mentors in the consulting group.
